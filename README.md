## Dataset: NASA Milling Data Set (PHM Society Repository)

**Source:** https://www.nasa.gov/intelligent-systems-division/discovery-and-systems-health/pcoe/pcoe-data-set-repository/

The dataset contains experiments from runs on a milling machine under various operating conditions, investigating tool wear (flank wear, crater wear, ect.). Data was recorded using three types of sensors:
- Acoustic Emission (AE) sensors (table and spindle),
- Vibration sensors (table and spindle), and
- Spindle motor current sensors (AC And DC)
